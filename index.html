    <p>
        Hi, Iâ€™m Harshith Shivakavi, a student at Cerritos College. I enjoy coding, playing the piano, and watching movies in my free time. 
        My dream is to become a software engineer and develop projects that can positively impact society. 
        I always push myself to learn something new and improve step-by-step. 
        Being around my family means a lot to me, and I enjoy going on trips with them whenever I get the chance. 
        Staying active is also important to me, so I try to balance things by hitting the gym and swimming now and then.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Like to Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exercising at the gym and swimming</li>
        <li>Traveling with family and spending quality time with them</li>
        <li>Listening to music and working on coding projects</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a> because I love watching movies and shows there to unwind.</p>
